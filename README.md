# CharadesGame-CoreMotion-Swift

I created this code for an app I originally released in 2015 and have been updating -less regularly than I would like to- ever since.

At the time I was 15/16 years old and was very challenging to find the right values to detect the iPhone orientation when a user wanted to "Pass" a word 
by moving it updwards, and mark it as "Correct" by moving it downwards.

Simply Run & Enjoy!
